# Demo Ideas: Optimizing On-Device Inference for Diffusion & LLM Models

Below is a list of demo ideas that integrate key components from the provided resources. Each demo highlights different optimization techniques from the paper, along with complementary tools from the AI Edge Torch Generative API, MediaPipe LLM Inference, and XNNPACK.

---

## 1. End-to-End Diffusion Model Inference Demo

**What to do:**
- Deploy a diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion 1.4) on a mobile device (or simulated mobile environment) using the AI Edge Torch pipeline and TF Lite runtime.
- Toggle optimization options such as specialized fused kernels for Group Norm/GELU, partially fused softmax, FlashAttention, and Winograd convolution.
- Measure and display inference latency and memory usage differences as you enable/disable each optimization.

**Key Components:**
- GPU-Aware optimizations from the paper (fused kernels, softmax optimizations, Winograd convolution).
- On-device execution via TF Lite with the XNNPACK delegate.

---

## 2. Attention Module Optimization Visualization

**What to do:**
- Implement two versions of the attention module: a baseline using standard softmax and an optimized version using partially fused softmax (and optionally FlashAttention for certain cases).
- Create a dashboard that visualizes per-layer latency, memory consumption, and throughput for each version.
- Allow users to interactively switch between modes to see real-time performance improvements.

**Key Components:**
- Attention module optimization techniques (fused softmax reduction, FlashAttention).
- Benchmarking insights similar to those presented in Table 1 of the paper.

---

## 3. Winograd Convolution Tuner

**What to do:**
- Develop a demo that replaces standard 3×3 convolutions in a key module (e.g., the image decoder) with a configurable Winograd convolution layer.
- Allow users to adjust the tile size (2×2, 4×4, 6×6, 8×8) and observe the trade-offs between computational savings and memory overhead.
- Present performance metrics (FLOPs reduction, latency, and memory usage) to highlight the optimal configuration.

**Key Components:**
- Winograd convolution optimizations as described in the paper.
- Integration with XNNPACK, which provides low-level acceleration.

---

## 4. Custom LLM Inference Demo with Multi-Signature Conversion

**What to do:**
- Re-author a compact transformer (e.g., TinyLlama) using the AI Edge Torch Generative API building blocks.
- Convert the model to a multi-signature TFLite model that separates prefill and decode functions, incorporating quantization and composite op lowering for performance.
- Deploy the model using the MediaPipe LLM Inference API and compare inference speed and resource usage with/without these optimizations.

**Key Components:**
- The AI Edge Torch authoring and conversion flow (including weight remapping, quantization APIs, and multi-signature export).
- On-device acceleration via TF Lite/XNNPACK delegate, emphasizing weight caching and composite op lowering.

---

## 5. Benchmarking Dashboard for Incremental Optimizations

**What to do:**
- Build a dashboard that sequentially applies optimization techniques (starting from a baseline implementation).
- For each stage (e.g., baseline, + fused softmax, + fused Group Norm/GELU, + FlashAttention, + Winograd), display metrics such as latency, memory usage for tensors and weights, and overall end-to-end inference time.
- Use graphs or tables to visualize how each optimization contributes to performance improvements.

**Key Components:**
- The incremental performance improvements detailed in the paper’s Table 1.
- Integration of metrics from both the TF Lite/XNNPACK side and the AI Edge Torch conversion pipeline.

## 2. Data Preparation

1. **Obtain a Dog Images Dataset:**
   - Download a dog images dataset (e.g., [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/)) or use a Kaggle dataset.
   - Organize the dataset into folders (e.g., `data/dogs/`) for use during fine-tuning.

2. **Preprocess the Data:**
   - Resize images to the resolution expected by your diffusion model (e.g., 512×512 pixels).
   - (Optional) Create a custom PyTorch `Dataset` and `DataLoader` for your training loop.

---

## 3. Fine-Tuning Stable Diffusion on Dog Images

1. **Load a Pre-trained Stable Diffusion Model:**
   - Use the [diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index) library to load a pre-trained checkpoint.

2. **Fine-Tune the Model:**

   In a new notebook cell, run:

   ```python
   from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
   import torch

   # Load pre-trained model (ensure you have sufficient GPU memory)
   model_id = "CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4"
   pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
   pipe.to("cuda")

   # (Optional) Modify the pipeline for fine-tuning on dog images
   # Define your custom training loop here to fine-tune on images from data/dogs/
   # For demonstration purposes, assume you have a fine-tuning script that saves a checkpoint:
   fine_tuned_checkpoint = "path/to/fine_tuned_dog_model"

   # Reload the fine-tuned model
   pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(fine_tuned_checkpoint, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
   pipe.to("cuda")
   ```

3. **Test Generation (Baseline):**

   ```python
   prompt = "A cute dog playing in a sunny park"
   image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
   image.save("baseline_dog.png")
   ```

---

## 4. Applying Optimizations Locally

To simulate the GPU-aware optimizations from the paper (e.g., specialized fused kernels, partially fused softmax, FlashAttention, and Winograd convolution), modify the inference pipeline as follows:

1. **Enable Optimized Kernels:**
   - If using a custom diffusion implementation or wrapper, set flags or pass parameters to enable optimizations. For example:

   ```python
   # Hypothetical flag to enable optimizations in our pipeline
   pipe.enable_optimizations = True
   ```

2. **Run Inference with Optimizations:**

   ```python
   optimized_image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
   optimized_image.save("optimized_dog.png")
   ```

---

## 5. Latency Tracking in Jupyter Notebook

1. **Measure Inference Latency (Unoptimized):**

   ```python
   import time

   # Warm-up run
   _ = pipe(prompt)

   # Measure unoptimized latency
   torch.cuda.synchronize()
   start = time.perf_counter()
   _ = pipe(prompt)
   torch.cuda.synchronize()
   unoptimized_latency = time.perf_counter() - start
   print(f"Unoptimized Inference Latency: {unoptimized_latency * 1000:.2f} ms")
   ```

2. **Measure Inference Latency (Optimized):**

   ```python
   # Ensure optimizations are enabled
   pipe.enable_optimizations = True

   # Warm-up run
   _ = pipe(prompt)

   # Measure optimized latency
   torch.cuda.synchronize()
   start = time.perf_counter()
   _ = pipe(prompt)
   torch.cuda.synchronize()
   optimized_latency = time.perf_counter() - start
   print(f"Optimized Inference Latency: {optimized_latency * 1000:.2f} ms")
   ```

3. **Log and Compare Results:**
   - Document the latency values (e.g., unoptimized ~1100 ms, optimized ~525 ms per inference iteration) as observed during tests.

---

## 6. Converting the Model for Mobile Deployment

1. **Export the Model using AI Edge Torch Generative API:**

   ```python
   import ai_edge_torch
   # Define input tensors for conversion (e.g., prefill tokens)
   prefill_tokens = torch.zeros((1, 512), dtype=torch.long, device="cpu")
   prefill_positions = torch.arange(512, device="cpu")

   # Convert the fine-tuned model to a multi-signature TFLite model
   edge_model = (
       ai_edge_torch.signature("prefill", pipe, (prefill_tokens, prefill_positions))
       .signature("decode", pipe, (torch.zeros((1, 1), dtype=torch.long, device="cpu"), torch.tensor([0], device="cpu")))
       .convert(quant_config="full_linear_int8_dynamic_recipe")  # Adjust quantization recipe as needed
   )
   tflite_file = "/tmp/stable_diffusion_dogs.tflite"
   edge_model.export(tflite_file)
   ```

2. **Verify the TFLite Model:**
   - Use TensorFlow Lite’s Python interpreter to run a simple inference test on your exported model.

---

## 7. Running the Model on a Mobile Application

1. **Integrate the TFLite Model into a Mobile App:**
   - For Android:
     - Place the TFLite file (`stable_diffusion_dogs.tflite`) in the `assets` folder.
     - Use the [TensorFlow Lite Android Interpreter API](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/inference) to load and run the model.
     - Example snippet:

       ```java
       // Java: Load TFLite model from assets
       Interpreter tflite = new Interpreter(loadModelFile("stable_diffusion_dogs.tflite"));
       // Set up input/output buffers and run inference:
       tflite.run(inputBuffer, outputBuffer);
       ```

   - For iOS:
     - Add the TFLite model to the Xcode project.
     - Use the [TensorFlow Lite Swift API](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/inference_ios) to load and run the model.
   
2. **Implement Latency Tracking on Mobile:**
   - Instrument the inference call by recording timestamps before and after the `interpreter.run(...)` call.
   - For example, on Android:

     ```java
     long startTime = System.nanoTime();
     tflite.run(inputBuffer, outputBuffer);
     long endTime = System.nanoTime();
     long latencyMs = (endTime - startTime) / 1_000_000;
     Log.d("Latency", "Inference Latency: " + latencyMs + " ms");
     ```

3. **Compare Optimized vs Unoptimized Mobile Inference:**
   - Deploy two versions of the app: one with the baseline (unoptimized) TFLite model and another with the optimized TFLite model.
   - Collect latency measurements using the above instrumentation and display/compare the results (e.g., via on-screen logs or a debugging console).

---
